    <a href="index.html">What is Git Stash</a>
    <p>Git Stash is a way to store the changes that you're made on a branch without having to commit them or add the, to a project that is being worked on. It is perfect for when you're in hte middle od something and you want to switch to doing something else</p>

    <p><strong>Hint</strong> If you see the following output when changing branches, you might want to consider using git stash. "Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches."</p>

    <p>To use stash simply run:</p>
    <code>git stash</code>

    <p>You can view your stashed changes by running <code>git stash list</code> This will show you a list of changes you have stored in the stash</p>

    <p>You can apply any given stash to whichever part of your project you like by running the following command <br>
    <code>git stash apply stash{i}</code>. i = the number that corresponds to the stash you want to apply
